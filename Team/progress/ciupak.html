This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Mitchell Ciupak</h2>

            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 4 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
			<br>
				<ul>
					<li>The main contribution my team members and I worked on this week was setting up our project site. This week we all used the template to create our current site, but I set up webhooks into our repository to automatically push the site to the shay server via SFTP.</li>
					<li>I spent time diagraming the design of the software.</li>
				</ul>
			</br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 11 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<ul>
  				<li>In an effort to finalize compoenent choices, I spent time shopping on various electronic suppliers as well as researching more about my main area of focus: Inertial Measurement Units. I spent time researching how accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers work in modern circuits.

				</li>
  				<li>As Systems Engineer, I spent time reading about software design in microcontrollers via online resources.</li>
  				<li>I created a testable work environemnt or playground with an STM32 to test code for next weeks "Show me a thing".</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>

			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 18 September 2020<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<p>This week my contributions to the team consisted of only a few things. In an effort to finalize our Bill of Materials, I researched the use of STEMMA QT connectors and it's effectiveness in our project. I researched battery chemistries and discharge curves with respect to a temperature range appropriate to fulfill our first PSSC (An ability to operate for 5 hours at 0 degrees Fahrenheit). Lastly, Kennedy, our team leader, took the initiative on this week's Show Me A Thing. However, in an effort to help debug with her, I discovered an STM32 Library that I believe will assist in the development of our project. Looking ahead, I plan to take the lead on next week's Show Me A Thing, order parts and begin familiarizing myself with our micro's documentation and </p>
			<ul>
					<li>STEMMA QT connectors are a combination of JST PH connectors used to connect additional peripherals to through pin connections or back to a STEMMA QT port. I believe the use of these connectors will help with 2 things. The convenience of connecting a component like the IMU. These connections will also help protect against power management mentioned in lectures. Images of these connectors can be seen below.

				</li>
					<li>While getting set up with a STM32F0, I stumbled across a resource called Hackster.io [4]. This site has a lot of reference material to use for STM32 based microcontrollers. Additionally, all of the tutorials include a library called stm32f0xx_hal [5]. This library holds many starter functions to make development on the STM32L4 easier.</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>

			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 25 September 2020<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 2<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<p>This week my contributions to the team outside of regular coursework and schedualed meetings only consisted of one thing. I studied Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and analyzed their potential application to our project.</p>
			<ul>
					<li>I researched the popular kernels mentioned in this week's lectures, ChibiOS[6], FreeRTOS[7], SafeRTOS[8], and Integrity[9]. The factors that I looked for in improving our system was the ability to improve our projects testing and event handling. After considering all these options, I as well as my teammates decided that we will be going in an Interrupt/Event Diven Approach due to its performance and power benefits.</li>
