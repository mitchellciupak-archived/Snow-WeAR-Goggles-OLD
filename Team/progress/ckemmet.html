            <h2>Progress Report for Carrie Kemmet</h2>

            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> September 11, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8:30 <br>
			<b><br>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			
			This week, I reviewed the theory behind the components that I am primarily responsible for and developed practical 
			ways to prototype the hardware. In addition to selecting the devices, I researched their applications, limits, programming, 
			and theory. I also ordered development kits so that I could start experimenting with them next week.

			<br><br>The two components that I focused on were the radio transceiver and the coulomb counter.  The research was mostly
			 conducted via the Google search engine. Detailed below are the main findings and how they impact the project.

			<br><br>Each Snow-weAR system requires a radio transceiver chip. After investigating various physical layer protocols, LoRa 
			(Long Range) protocol was selected. The advantages of LoRa are that it’s license free, low power, and high range, which is a
			 trade-off for the low data rate [1]. I found several development kits and a wide variety of source code[2] for the selected
			 chip that demonstrates ease of use and a wide range of capabilities.

					<td>Although this application of LoRa only requires point to point communication, the LoRaWAN communication protocol 
					allows expansion to mesh networking. This LPWAN (low power wide area network) network stack allows bidirectional 
					communication between a gateway and several nodes spread across kilometers and has important applications across industry, 
					from agriculture to smart cities [3]. Future projects could expand on Snow-weAR to increase range, data availability, and 
					processing.</td>

                    <td>In addition to researching LoRa, I also checked out various power monitoring methods, primarily ADC’s and coulomb
						counters. Because we are using a Lithium Ion battery, a coulomb counter is more appropriate for the application. This is because
						 battery consumption is less strongly correlated with voltage variance and ADC’s therefore provide little accuracy. [4]
						 Coulomb counters function by integrating current flowing through the circuit over time and relaying the SOC (State of Charge), or the 
						 ratio between the amount of energy currently stored and the capacity. [5] This coulomb counter will allow the system to accurately 
						 report charge and discharge, within 10% as stated within the PSSC, and potentially down to 1% error.

			I also bought an Arduino Uno and a set of modules to start experimenting with LoRa. I plan on using the Arduino to conduct experiments due 
			to ease of use and the presence of existing libraries, and on the other end of the transceiver I will use the project microcontroller to ensure
			successful implementation. A coulomb counter module by SparkFun was also identified and will be ordered for prototyping purposes. [6]

			This week, I spent a lot of time on the homework, because it was my turn to do the assignment. Aside from that, I spent a 
			lot of time organizing our schematic now that we have our components selected. I did some research on voltage regulators and discovered 
			that our system needed an LDO regulator due to the small difference between the supply voltage and the highest voltage required by any 
			component. I also researched various batteries and determined the minimum power requirements for a battery to last the amount of time 
			needed for the functional specifications.

		Pictured is part of the work I did on the schematic. In a file, I saved images of sample schematics for every component. 
					I divided the components into three systems: sensing, power, and radio. I then generalized the diagrams by including output
					 pins from the schematics and their connections. The purpose of this is to see how all of the chips interact with each other,
					  the main processor, and the voltage source. Any wires or small components that are part of detailed circuitry are not 
					  included. These diagrams will inform the final design of the schematic and also help confirm that all currents and voltages 
					  meet system requirements.

			Most of this week was spent interfacing with development kits for the components that we will use for our final implementation. Pictured below is my setup.
			I also spent time configuring an Arduino Uno and LCD, however, I later realized that this is currently unnecessary, although it may come in handy later.
			I spent considerable time trying to interface with the transceiver chip, and was unable to establish a serial connection. The CP210x driver on my computer isn't 
			recognizing the chip so I need to reconfigure that.

			Although I didn't get much working on the hardware side, I learned a lot about the procedure of programming the transciever chip. This includes the steps needed 
			during the setup period, as well as the various modes that it can enter, such as a receeving state. Additionally, familiarized myself with the transmission 
			protocol and with unpacking incoming data. The Github repository that I am using to supplement the datasheet information can be found <a 
			href="https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/tree/master/src/lora">here</a>.
