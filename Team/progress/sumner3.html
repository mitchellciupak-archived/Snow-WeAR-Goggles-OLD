            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9-9-2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<td>Throughout the project I will be working on implementing the GPS module. The focus of this week was to research GPS operation and possible 
				GPS modules to use. GPS receivers use a satellite constellation of at least 24 satellites to calculate potision at a given time. To do this calculation 
				accurately the receiver must be able to lock onto 4 satellites and the satellite configuration ensures that this is always possible [1].

					<td>Only basic functionality of a GPS is needed to receive coordinate and alititude data as required for the project. Since the GPS 
						requirements are minimal, the feature I determined to be most important was power consumption. The goggles will be battery operated for hours at 
						a time and selecting low power components is key. Some modules, like the MTK3339 by Adafruit, have a sleep mode that can be activated to lower
						consumption further [2]. The GPS will only be actively receiving when requested by the user so this could be a useful fucntion.<br>

			<b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<table>
				<td>This week I ordered a GPS breakout, specifically the Ultimate GPS Breakout from Adafruit [3]. Unfortunately, the parts did not arrive in time 
					to begin working with the module this week. Nevertheless, I did some digging to determine how to properly program the GPS and set up a testing 
					environment with Arduino. Adafruit has published a GPS library compatible with the module that is open-source and can be found on GitHub [4].
					The relevant functions and variables to this project are found in the header file. The GPS module can be connected via either SPI or I2C and in 
					addition to housing functions, the library also contains basic examples for how each could be structured.

				<td>A portion of an Arduino script is shown on the left that establishes working communication with the GPS module. The setup section
					sets the baud rate and configures the GPS output. It then enters a loop as the GPS receives and digests data. GPS data is packaged in the form of National Marine 
					Electronics Association (NMEA) sentences [5]. Each sentence contains all of the data collected for a specific point in time. When the GPS receives an NMEA sentence 
					each variable must be extracted individually. <br>
				<br>As data for each of the individual variables is collected it is printed to the console output. Once the hardware portion is implemented, this will enable 
					me to assess the accuracy of data received as well as mirror the display a goggle wearer will have in the final implementation of the project.

			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 9-25-2020<br>
			<b>Total hours: </b>16<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
	 		<td>This week I began working with the GPS module using an Arduino Uno. The wiring of the module is shown in Figure 1. On the right side of the 
				photo is a wire that extends from the GPS breakout board. This connects to the GPS antenna (Figure 2) that must be placed outside or it 
				will struggle to properly get a location fix on any satellites.

			<br>
			<td>When I first attempted to connect to the GPS and request data, I was couldn't get the GPS antenna to get a fix. I was able to receive empty sets of
				data through the Arduino, so even though everything was connected properly on my end the antenna was not acquiring satellite signals. The 
				solution to this ended up being to wait for about 30 minutes and then data finally started to come in. The raw GPS data is received in the format of NMEA
				sentences which are somewhat readable to the eye but not very useful until they are parsed. I utilized the Adafruit GPS library [4] to successfully parse 
				the data and output in a useful format to the Arduino serial monitor. I included a screen capture of my serial output below in Figure 3. There 
				are two sets of data from two timestamps and for each set I printed the time, date, fix status, location, speed, angle, altitude, and number of 
				satellites. The last four lines that begin with "$GPXXX" show the NMEA sentence data format that I echoed to the output for debugging purposes.

			<td>Acquiring data from the GPS is an exciting milestone for this portion of the project. While stationed in my room, the GPS gives accurate data 
				and now the next steps will be to test the accuracy as location and speed change and then to implement the functionality using the chosen STM32
				microcontroller. Another factor I will need to keep in mind is the time taken to acquire a location fix and I will be looking into ways to 
				minimize this as much as possible.

			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 10-2-2020<br>
			<b>Total hours: </b>10<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			<td>This week I worked more with the GPS module using Arduino. After getting the GPS to connect last week I wanted to verify that I was properly 
				utilizing the GPS module and receiving accurate information. For the project it is important that the GPS provides accurate location information 
				and updates itself quickly. Most people who use their phone for navigation, including myself, have probably experienced the annoyance of their 
				GPS location on screen lagging behind their actual location. I had a friend drive around to assess the accuracy of the readings I was getting from 
				the GPS as I changed location. We stopped outside of Igloo Frozen Custard in West Lafayette to check coordinate and altitude data.<br><br> 
				The actual location data for this point is: <br>

				<b>Latitude: </b>40.3680<br>
				<b>Longitude: </b>-86.8755<br>
				<b>Altitude: </b>193m [6]<br><br>

				And the reported GPS data was:<br>
				<b>Latitude: </b>40.3678<br>
				<b>Longitude: </b>-86.8742<br>
				<b>Altitude: </b>195.1<br><br>

				Considering I took the measurements from the parking lot and could not go inside for the most accurate results, these numbers are quite 
				acceptable. I configured the GPS to print an update on its current state every second and noticed that while the coordinates remained consistent, 
				the altitude data would change a bit each time but remained within about two meters of the target value. For the future, I think altitude may need 
				to be calculated as the average of several measurements. <br><br>

				I also wanted to make sure that the GPS was not lagging as it reported data. This would have been difficult to test using purely coordinate data 
				because I didn't know what my coordinates should have been at every data point. I also didn't trust that comparing to another GPS would be 
				guarantee unbiased results. I instead used speed as the metric to verify that the GPS was updating fast enough. In a car it was very easy to 
				check the correct speed by looking at the odometer. While driving around, I quickly found out that the GPS was giving speed in knots and made that
				adjustment to my code. <br><br>

				Below is some footage from the excursion that shows the GPS in action. The first video in Figure 1 shows the location data from Igloo and Figure 3 
				shows the car's odometer compared to the GPS output. Figures 2 and 4 show screenshots from the videos to more easily read the data.<br><br>
